Practice creating a website with HTML, CSS, Javascript 
Before hearing about Git Hub I planned on creating my own poertfolio website. This was the website, it is not finished but enjoyed working with HTML CSS and Javascript. 
By doing this project I learned in HTML how to create the layout of the website. CSS to add better visuals, and a tad of javascript to add some visual effects.
